Hi all,

Recently again 2nd time, I have gone through Interview Process at Amazon for their GeoFlex Program.

1st Step was Shortlisting your profile among many applications.

2nd Step was Recruiter Call to explain process and general Questions.

3rd Step was Online Assessment on Codelity/HackerRank.

4th Step was Live Coding/Problem Solving Round.

5th Step is usually another Technical Interview for System Design / Architecture or General Tech questions.
But I didn't reach at this stage.

Sharing Questions that were being asked in last 2 steps.

Recruiter was very professional and cooperative.
Yes it was tough and you have to be well prepared. I think the key to clear this coding round is to practice alot of questions related all data structures from easy to medium to difficult in different platforms.

What's your experience ? Share in comments.
